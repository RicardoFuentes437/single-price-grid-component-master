## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For me this challenge was more about practicing things that i learned in the past and trying to perfectionate my coding skills.

### Continued development

So far i've used flexbox for majority so i think it would be interesting to work with CSS Grid in the next few challenges to learn more about it and how it works.
